### (Talk) Scaling Architecture Decision Making (Trendyol Istanbul Meetup Jan 2020)
https://pt.slideshare.net/patkua/scaling-architecture-decision-making-trendyol-istanbul-meetup-jan-2020
> In the fast moving startup world, there’s often not a lot time to think about architecture. As I grew N26 Tech almost 8x to 370 people in just over two years, I wanted to make sure we made good technical decisions and not just grow chaotically.
> 
> This talk explores how we introduced a number of practices how to decentralise and scale out architectural decision making.

### (Keynote) Building Evolutionary Architectures** (W-Jax Munich Nov 2019) Nov 2019 Keynote
https://pt.slideshare.net/patkua/building-evolutionary-architectures-wjax-munich-nov-2019-nov-2019-keynote
>In our industry, one of the only guarantees is change. Many of today’s tools, technologies, and business models will soon cease to exist, only to be replaced by newer ones. Architects face the challenge of planning for today’s systems knowing that the problems of tomorrow will be completely different from the problems of today. Evolutionary architecture is an architectural approach that prioritises change as a first principle but balances this need with delivering value early.

### (Livro) Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software
![(Livro Domain Driven Design](Livro-Domain-Driven-Design.png)
> "The lesson of Eric's experience is that the **really powerful domain models evolve over time**, and even the most experienced modelers find that they gain their best ideas after the initial releases of a system"
— Martin Fowler, Chief Scientist at ThoughtWorks
